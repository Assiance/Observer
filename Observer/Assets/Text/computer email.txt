" Mr.Toofly85- What the hell man why are you backing out? I need you for this mission.

CavedHermit- Hey don't blame me Turner needs me to stay docked. We have our inspection coming up and he has been riding us.

Mr.Toofly85- That's a load of crap. You always find some way to avoid planet drops.

CavedHermit- What's your deal? Why are you so strung up on this?

Mr.Toofly85- SCREW YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will scout the planet myself.

CavedHermit- It's dangerous to go alone."
