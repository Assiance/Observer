The player interacts with a book titled "Love from Viscount."

" Vladimir perked up when Ginmarie shoved him on the bed. She was so rough and aggressive, he liked it. She resembled a mountain cat, who was toy with its prey before it delivered the final strike. Vlad was excited in more ways than one. From Ginmarie's attitude and the attire she chose for the evening, she was perfect. His heart began to race and his feral instincts started to kick in."
